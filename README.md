# TwoWayGWAS
R codes for two-way genome-wide association analyses to detect genome-genome interactions between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae   

A small sample data are provided to illustrate how two-way GWAS was conducted, including
  (1) genotypes for N1 rice accessions
  (2) genotype for N2 Xoo species
  (3) phenotype (leaf lesion length) between each rice accession and Xoo species.
 
For each pair of variants (a rice one and an Xoo one), a linear model including N1-1 rice covariants and N2-1 Xoo coraviates is used to test their interaction:

pheno ~ rice_geno + xoo_geno + rice_geno:xoo_geno + rice_covariates + xoo_corariates
